# Sinon / Jest

[Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) is a robust tool for creating spies, stubs and mocks. However, when you're running [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) as your test framework, it too provides functions for creating test doubles.

This repository holds test functions that do similar things in both Sinon and Jest.

## Installing

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

## Running tests

Run `yarn test` to run tests. This will launch a test watcher, so modifications to the test will run the modified tests again.
